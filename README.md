Experiments with entropy and Artificial Intelligence

Overview
This repository contains advanced Python scripts for statistical analysis focusing on Gaussian distributions, entropy measurements in a geometric context, and analysis of centralized data assuming independent and identically distributed (iid) characteristics. These tools are designed for researchers and data scientists looking to explore complex statistical models and data behavior in various scientific and engineering applications.

Contents
gaussian_analysis.py
Description: This script performs detailed analysis using Gaussian distributions. It includes functionality for fitting models to data, estimating parameters, and evaluating the statistical properties of Gaussian-based models.
geometric_analysis_of_entropy.py
Description: Dedicated to the study of entropy within geometric data structures. This script calculates entropy measurements and explores their implications in data complexity and information theory.
iid_centralized_data.py
Description: Analyzes centralized data under the assumption that it is iid. This script is useful for statistical inference, providing insights into data patterns and distribution without the influence of data correlations.


Getting Started
To use these scripts:

Clone the repository using git clone [repository-url].
Ensure that you have Python installed on your machine. These scripts were tested on Python 3.8.
Install necessary dependencies by running pip install -r requirements.txt (Note: you must create this file based on the libraries used in the scripts).

Usage
To run any of the scripts, navigate to the repository directory and execute:
python <script_name.py>
Replace <script_name.py> with the name of the script you wish to run.
